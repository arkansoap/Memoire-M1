```{r}
data <- Caravan
summary(data)
str(data)
plot(data$Purchase)
```

The training and test sets were created using stratiﬁed random sampling.

First, split the training set off:

```{r}
set.seed(156)
split1 <- createDataPartition(data$Purchase, p = .7)[[1]]
other <- data[-split1,]
training <- data[ split1,]
```

Now create the evaluation and test sets :

```{r}
set.seed(934)
split2 <- createDataPartition(data$Purchase, p = 1/3)[[1]]
evaluation <- other[ split2,]
testing <- other[-split2,]
```

Determine the predictor names :

```{r}
predictors <- names(training)[names(training) != "Purchase"]
```
