# Remedies

A lot of research have been made concerning this problem. Our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of all the technics to remedies this issue. 
In this study, we will focus on methods than we can repoduce with our level of competence. It appears to us that it is interesting to separate the choosen methods in three levels :

* First, some remedies we can use before launching the machine learning algorithm (Preprocessing).
* Secundly, some remedies we can use during the computation of a fitted models by the machine (learning method tuning).
* At last, som remedies that can be used after the machine learning algorithm (postprocessing).

## different strategies : 

- Special-purpose learning method : Modifications of the learning algorithm
    - advantages : 
        - users goals are incorporated directly into the models 
        - model obtained more comprehensive for the users
    - disadvantages : 
        - user is restricted in his algorithmm choices or have to developp new algorithm
        - if the target of the loss function changes, model must be relearned
        - requires deep knowlegde of the learning algorithm implementation
- Data Pre-processing : changes on the data before the learning process takes place
    - advantages:
        - can be applied to any existing tools 
        - choosen models are biased to the goals of the users 
    - inconevnient:
        - difficult to relate modification of the data with the loss function
- Prediction Post-processing : transformations applied to the predictions of the learned model
    - advantages :
        - not necessary to know user preference biases at learning time
        - any standard learning tool can be used
    - drawbavks : 
        - models do not reflect user preferences
        - models interpretability is meaningless because loss function was not optimized following user preference bias

## Pre processing resampling 

A lot of method exists in order to rebalanced a sample. Since the begin of the 21th century, a lot of studies appears in order to manage and discuss about resampling. Some methods are more sophisticated than other and might give better results, but they have no consensus on a technic whive have better results. Globally we can say it is the most commun and popular remedies to counteract imbalanced data for two key reasons : we can us the resample datas with all classisfiers and it gives generally pretty goods results.

The first "basic" try of resampling is obviously try to make random over sampling or down sampling. Over sampling consists in duplicate randomly positive cases in order to reach two class with approximatively the qame number of case. Downsampling consists in randomly enlever some negative cases in order to diminush the negative classes. Then we can easily imagine other way to select the cases otted or duplicate. Moreover, we can mix try to mix the two methods. Some try
resampling dataset method:
  
Japkowicz (2000 )discussed the effect of imbalance in a dataset. Two resampling methods were considered.Random resampling consisted of resampling the smaller class at random until it consisted of as many samples as the majority class and “focused resampling” consisted of resampling only those minority examples that occurred on the boundary between the minority and majority classes. Random under-sampling was considered, which involved under-sampling the majority class samples at random until their numbers matched the number of minority class samples; focused under-sampling involved under-sampling the majority class samples lying further away. She noted that both the sampling approaches were effective, and she also observed that using the sophisticated sampling techniques did not give any clear advantage in the domain considered (Japkowicz, 2000)

One approach that is particularly relevant to our work is that of Ling and Li (1998).They combined over-sampling of the minority class with under-sampling of the majorityclass

in order to try and discuss those resamplig procedees, the part "application"  shows examples of random up and down sampling in order to make comparison with more sophisticated method as SMOTE and ROSE. 

### CARET up and down sample : 

"downSample will randomly sample a data set so that all classes have the same frequency as the minority class. upSample samples with replacement to make the class distributions equal"

### ROSE

Creates a sample of synthetic  data by enlarging the features space of minority and majority class examples. Operationally, the new examples are down from a conditionnal kernel density estimate of the two classes as describe in Menardi and torelli (2013)

The ROSE strategy to deal with class imbalance
ROSE (Menardi and Torelli, 2014) provides a unified framework to deal simultaneously with the two
above-mentioned problems of model estimation and accuracy evaluation in imbalanced learning. It
builds on the generation of new artificial examples from the classes, according to a smoothed bootstrap
approach (see, e.g., Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).
Consider a training set Tn, of size n, whose generic row is the pair (xi, yi), i = 1, . . . , n. The class
labels yi belong to the set fY0, Y1g, and xi are some related attributes supposed to be realizations of a
random vector x defined on Rd, with an unknown probability density function f (x). Let the number of
units in class Yj, j = 0, 1, be denoted by nj < n. The ROSE procedure for generating one new artificial
example consists of the following steps:
1. Select y = Yj with probability pj.
2. Select (xi, yi) 2 Tn, such that yi = y, with probability 1
nj
.
3. Sample x from KHj (, xi), with KHj a probability distribution centered at xi and covariance
matrix Hj.
Essentially, we draw from the training set an observation belonging to one of the two classes, and generate
a new example (x, y) in its neighborhood, where the shape of the neighborhood is determined
by the shape of the contour sets of K and its width is governed by Hj.
It can be easily shown that, given selection of the class label Yj, the generation of new examples
from Yj, according to ROSE, corresponds to the generation of data from the kernel density estimate of
f (xjYj), with kernel K and smoothing matrix Hj (Menardi and Torelli, 2014). The choices of K and
Hj may be then addressed by the large specialized literature on kernel density estimation (see, e.g.
Bowman and Azzalini, 1997). It is worthwhile to note that, for Hj ! 0, ROSE collapses to a standard
combination of over- and under-sampling.
Repeating steps 1 to 3 m times produces a new synthetic training set T
m, of size m, where the
imbalance level is defined by the probabilities pj (if pj = 1/2, then approximately the same number of
examples belong to the two classes). The size m may be set to the original training set size n or chosen
in any way

### Smote family (smoteNC, BLSMOTE, ADASYN)

smote chawla quote :

We propose an over-sampling approach in which the minority class is over-sampled by cre-ating “synthetic” examples rather than by over-sampling with replacement. This approachis inspired by a technique that proved successful in handwritten character recognition (Ha& Bunke, 1997).  They created extra training data by performing certain operations onreal data.  In their case, operations like rotation and skew were natural ways to perturbthe training data. We generate synthetic examples in a less application-specific manner, byoperating in “feature space” rather than “data space”. The minority class is over-sampledby taking each minority class sample and introducing synthetic examples along the linesegments joining any/all of thekminority class nearest neighbors.  Depending upon theamount of over-sampling required, neighbors from theknearest neighbors are randomlychosen.  Our implementation currently uses five nearest neighbors.  For instance, if theamount of over-sampling needed is 200%, only two neighbors from the five nearest neigh-bors are chosen and one sample is generated in the direction of each.  Synthetic samplesare generated in the following way: Take the difference between the feature vector (sample)under consideration and its nearest neighbor. Multiply this difference by a random numberbetween 0 and 1, and add it to the feature vector under consideration.  This causes theselection of a random point along the line segment between two specific features.  Thisapproach effectively forces the decision region of the minority class to become more general

SMOTE (Chawla et. al. 2002) is a well-known algorithm to fight this problem. The general idea of this method is to artificially generate new examples of the minority class using the nearest neighbors of these cases. Furthermore, the majority class examples are also under-sampled, leading to a more balanced dataset.

The SMOTE function oversamples your rare event by using bootstrapping and k-nearest neighbor to synthetically create additional observations of that event. The definition of rare event is usually attributed to any outcome/dependent/target/response variable that happens less than 15% of the time. For more details about this algorithm, read the original white paper, SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, from its creators.

## Learning method tuning

### Metaparameters tuning

A first try can be to handle the parameters of the classifiers used. Empirycally we'll see part 5 application that it don't give some significants results. We coul wait for this results because parameters of classifiers are not ax on it. 

### Weighted class

We try to attribute some weights to our class but the results was not convinced. We try different ways and look for serious or significant results with this methods but it seems that it don't give results. Maybe the algorithm incorporing these results must be reshaped. 

The best try trying to handle with classifiers during the learning phase was to incorporate a cost matrix. We choose to use it with decision tree because the algorithm CART shows good results in the literrature.

### direct sensitive learning with cart classifer

The incorporation of beneﬁts and/or costs (negative beneﬁts) in existing algorithms, as a way to express the utility of diﬀerent predictions, is one of the known approaches to cope with imbalanced domains.

Instead of optimizing the typical performance measure, such as accuracy or impurity, some models can alternatively optimize a cost or loss function that diﬀerentially weights speciﬁc types of errors. (no results with weighted data but cart works)

Theory
We summarize the theory of cost-sensitive learning, published mostly in (Elkan, 2001; Zadrozny
and Elkan, 2001). The theory describes how the misclassification cost plays its essential role in
various cost-sensitive learning algorithms.

Cost Matrix: A matrix that assigns a cost to each cell in the confusion matrix.
The example below is a cost matrix where we use the notation C() to indicate the cost, the first value represented as the predicted class and the second value represents the actual class. The names of each cell from the confusion matrix are also listed as acronyms, e.g. False Positive is FP.

table

We can see that the cost of a False Positive is C(1,0) and the cost of a False Negative is C(0,1).

This formulation and notation of the cost matrix comes from Charles Elkan’s seminal 2001 paper on the topic titled “The Foundations of Cost-Sensitive Learning.”

An intuition from this matrix is that the cost of misclassification is always higher than correct classification, otherwise, cost can be minimized by predicting one class.

Conceptually, the cost of labeling an example incorrectly should always be greater than the cost of labeling it correctly.

— The Foundations Of Cost-sensitive Learning, 2001.

Total Cost = C(0,1) * False Negatives + C(1,0) * False Positives
This is the value that we seek to minimize in cost-sensitive learning, at least conceptually.

This cost matrix method can be used in different ways (...), in our applications part 5, we'll focus on cart.

Alternate Cutoffs

Not efficient in my spotify works

> When there are two possible outcome categories, another method for increasing the prediction accuracy of the minority class samples is to determine alternative cutoﬀs for the predicted probabilities

Not a real solution for our issue because it changes our definition classes 

> which eﬀectively changes the deﬁnition of a predicted event. 

Unless we do it with care / i don't think it is a good solution

> There may be situations where the sensitivity/speciﬁcity trade-oﬀ can be accomplished without severely compromising the accuracy of the majority class (which, of course, depends on the context of the problem)

Interesting if : 

- focus on a compromise beetween sensityvioty and specificity.
> particular target that must be met for the sensitivity or speciﬁcity,
- we want to maximise accuracy.
> Find the point on the ROC curve that is closest (i.e., the shortest distance) to the perfect model (with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % speciﬁcity)
- use of Youden's J index ???
> (see Sect. 11.2), which measures the proportion of correctly predicted samples
